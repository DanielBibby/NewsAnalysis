# News Analysis Project 

This is a project that uses NewsAPI to retrieve articles from over ?500?
news sources and perform sentiment analysis on the article descriptions.

This project includes a frontend that allows a user to input a company
and ticker of their choice and see some visualisations of how positively
news articles have been reporting on that company for up to the past month
along with the stock price of that ticker.
